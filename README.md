# The-First-API-with-JS
Making this very mini-project was easy on the part of HTML and CSS but the most exiciting part was that I used API for the first time and got to know of its importance.
It has been very easy to fetch data from ready to use APIs. I have used XML HTTP request method to send a request to API. In conclusion, this was an amazing experience of 
getting something done without much hardwork in terms of fetching data.
Objectives Achieved:
-> Generation of Dynamic Data
-> By changing a single word in the script the entire data would be changed
-> Dynamic content generation along with avoidance of unneccesary page-reloading
